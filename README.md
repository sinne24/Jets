# Jets Application

### Description
  The jets application is an airfield simulation. When launched the airfield is immediately populated with default aircraft from a local Jets.txt file.
Upon launch the user is met with a menu interface. The user may view a list of the aircraft, have them perform tasks based on the aircraft type, or add and remove aircraft. When prompted the user chooses from the menu by entering the corresponding number on the menu. The menu continues populating until the user chooses to quit.

### Tech Used
 Eclipse IDE
 
### Things Learned
  Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and other core object oriented programming concepts were heavily reinforced in this excercise. Of this week's topics, interfaces and file reading are furthest from my comfort zone. Using the line.split and parse syntax as well as the buffer reader were brand new territory. Thus, the AirField class of the application and first four user stories were the most difficult.I worked slowly and tread carefully during that portion of the program, as well as relied on gathering previous code I'd written to avoid simple syntactical errors that would otherwise be easily missed. Implementing interfaces was trickier conceptually, but easier to physically code. Overall, this week seemed like a learning experience of all things fundamental to OOP and more precisely Java. From here I'd like to revisit these concepts frequently and practice using APIE in the literal sense and reading in to parse files, so I may gain more comfort in these common topics.
